During a time interval $\\Delta t$ some animals will die and some new will be born. The number of deaths and births are expected to be proportional to $N$.

    "The good thing about the Forward Euler method is that it gives an understanding of what a differential equation is and a geometrical picture of how to construct the solution. The first idea is that it have already computed the solution up to some time point $t_{n} .$ The second idea is that the solution could be progressed from $t_{n}$ to $t_{n+1}$ as a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is knowed that the line must go through the solution at $t_{n},$ i.e., the point $\\left(t_{n}, u^{n}\\right)$. The differential equation tells about the slope of the line: $u^{\\prime}\\left(t_{n}\\right)=f\\left(u^{n}, t_{n}\\right)=r u^{n}$ That is, the differential equation gives a direct formula for the further direction of the solution curve. It can be sayed that the differential equation expresses how the system\n",

    "There is a general formula for a straight line $y=a x+b$ with slope $a$ that goes through the point $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right): y=a\\left(x-x_{0}\\right)+y_{0}$. Using this formula adapted to the present case, and evaluating the formula for $t_{n+1}$, results in\n",

The reader are now encouraged to perform the [__portfolio exercise: Geometric Construction of the Forward Euler method__](https://github.com/Xiuhcoatl-013/Numerical-Methods/blob/master/notes/portfolio/portfolio.ipynb) to become more familiar with the geometric interpretation of the Forward Euler method."
